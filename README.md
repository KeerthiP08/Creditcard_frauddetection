**CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION**  
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various transaction features such as transaction amount, merchant information, and user details.

**Data Loading:** Load the dataset using pandas and display basic information about it, including its shape and data types.   
**Handling Missing Values:** Check for missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately.    
**Visualizing Data:** Visualize the distribution of fraud labels, transaction dates, merchant categories, and other relevant aspects using various plots.   
**Data Preprocessing:** Convert date columns to datetime format, extract features from transaction dates, and preprocess categorical features.   
**Modeling Data:** Preprocess the data for the model, split it into training and testing sets, and train a neural network model using PyTorch.    
**Training Loop:** Execute the training loop for a specified number of epochs, monitor the loss at regular intervals, and use a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training.
